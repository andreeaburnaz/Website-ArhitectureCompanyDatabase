A website created for the activities management in a Romanian architecture company.

"Art Life" has all the information about its projects. For
a good efficiency of the stages of a project, the company stores in a database
information about: ongoing projects, activities that could be allocated to
a specific project, contracts of the company and parteners.
The website was implemented using PHP, MySql, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
It has an interface for customers, where they can read and find out details
about our business, and an administration part (which can be accessed after a log-in).
In the administration part you can delete, insert and modify data from
database.
